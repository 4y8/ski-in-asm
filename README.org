#+TITLE: SKI in asm
A interpreter for extended SKI combinators (including C, B, S', C', B* plus for
Z (zero) and U (succ) for church numerals).
* How to use
Each combinator is represented by a number from 0 to 9, any other number is an application.
| Number | Combinator |
|--------+------------|
|      0 | S          |
|      1 | K          |
|      2 | U          |
|      3 | Z          |
|      4 | I          |
|      5 | B          |
|      6 | C          |
|      7 | S'         |
|      8 | B*         |
|      9 | C'         |
To create a program you need to lists, the stack which represents the program
and the nodelist which is list of internal nodes (application). The nodelist
consist of a list of pair of two values, they can be combinators or other
internal nodes. An internal node is described by a number n superior to ten.
It is the application of nodelist[n - 10] and nodelist[n - 9].
